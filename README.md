## Learn Terraform CDKTF - Assets, Stacks and Lambda

This is a companion repository for the Hashicorp [Deploy Multiple Lambda Functions with TypeScript](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-assets-stacks-lambda) tutorial. 
The `cdktf` directory contains all the CDKTF configuration. The `lambda-hello-world` and `lambda-hello-name` are sample Lambda functions that print "Hello world" and "Hello name", where `name` is the `name` query parameter.
